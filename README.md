# convertEQ
The WEB application to convert generic parametric EQ filters to JSON for Poweramp Equalizer app

## Project goal
The main problem is the Poweramp Equalizer affects on sound signal otherwise than other apps like EqualizerAPO or DSP processors such as miniDSP. Also, it's impossible to predict the result of acoustic correction by REW's built-in equalizer or by other apps. So for precise correction it's necessary to set filters manually with real time analyze, or to convert generic filters to Poweramp Filters by mathematical transformations. 

## Features
The app receive a text file with filters for generic parametric equalizer, generated by Room EQ Wizard (REW) or by other software and convert it to Poweramp Equalizer app-specific JSON file. Also it demonstrate a graph of the filters. Maybe later i will add an authorization and realise database with user's EQ filters.

## Plan
* [ ] create simple user interface (button and drag-and-drop zone)
* [ ] implement file reading
* [ ] implement base file editing and saving as json
* [ ] research Poweramp EQ's algorythms and create own mathematical algorythm to convert generic EQ filters
* [ ] finalize file editing
* [ ] add users authorization
* [ ] add database for keeping user's filters
