# convertEQ
The WEB application to convert generic parametric EQ filters to JSON for Poweramp Equalizer app

## Features
The app receive a text file with filters for generic parametric equalizer and convert it to Poweramp Equalizer app-specific JSON file. 
Initial text file may be generated by Room EQ Wizard (REW) or with other software.

The main problem is the Poweramp Equalizer affects on sound signal otherwise than other apps like EqualizerAPO or DSP processors such as miniDSP. So for precise acoustic correction it's necessary to set filters manually with real time analyze, or to convert generic filters to Poweramp Filters by mathematical transformations. Also, it's impossible to predict the result of correction by REW's built-in equalizer or by other apps.
